    <h1>Target Audience</h1>
    <p>
      My primary target audience for this website is older people who are
      looking to retire or go on vacation for a family reunion. <br />
      <br />
      The secondary target audience is mother's of families who have children.
      Let's be real, mom's do the planning for trips the most, especially in
      Utah and Idaho. <br />
    </p>

    <h1>Personas and Scenarios</h1>

    <h2 class="targetpersona">Persona 1 - Deborah</h2>
    <h3 class="scenarios">Scenario 1</h3>
    <p class="targetpara">
      My name is Deborah and I am having a big family reunion in Soda Springs,
      ID. We do have some concerns though about the weather beause it's January.
      I need weather updates up until the day before we get there to make sure
      that it's safe for my family that's going to be driving in.
    </p>

    <h3 class="scenarios">Scenario 2</h3>
    <p class="targetpara">
      Hey! It's Deborah again, we were so excited with our trip to Fish Haven,
      ID that we actually want to retire there! We do want to know what we can
      expect with the weather though so we want to be able to watch it this
      winter and take notes of how bad the snow really can be. I need to have a
      website that I can easily navigate to and watch what the weather is like
      there! Do you know of one?
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2 class="targetpersona">Persona 2 - Michelle</h2>
    <h3 class="scenarios">Scenario 3</h3>
    <p class="targetpara">
      Hey! This is Michelle, I've got a family of 5 including my husband and I
      and we need to know what the weather is going to be like this weekend so I
      can plan a quick litte get away! We are running on a little bit of short
      notice so I need a website that will give me the most accurate information
      right now! Have you heard of littletownweather.com?
    </p>

    <h3 class="scenarios">Scenario 4</h3>
    <p class="targetpara">
      It's Michelle again and I have great news! We added another kid to the
      family! My husband and I need a break so we can retain what sanity we have
      left though. Do you know the weather in Soda Springs, ID tomorrow? We have
      got to get out of this house!
    </p>

    <h3 class="scenarios">Scenario 5</h3>
    <p class="targetpara">
      Guess who?! It's Michelle. Our kids are grown up now and like teenagers
      they want to take the car and some friends up to Preston, ID. I need to be
      able to watch the weather though when they go and I need an accurate
      website so I don't stress out too much. Do you know of a good webite that
      I can visit?
