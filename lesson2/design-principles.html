            White space is the blank space that you leave on purpose. In this
            example, you can see each layer of the burger but because of the
            alignment you know that they all belong together. The reason why you
            would want to separate these is to emphasize the ingredients and the
            best way is to use white space. It creates a crisp, clean, organized
            look that you can’t get by muddling the space.

            The Rule of Thirds is a hard and fast law that works in all
            instances. If you divide your photo into thirds (two lines
            equidistant) you have your layout. Put your subject, what you want
            to focus on, at the intersection of one of those lines and you are
            set! In this photo the couple is in the top left intersection, the
            photo is emphasizing them as they are filling almost 50% of the
            space which is a huge amount in the photo.

            How long does it take your user to move between targets. If you want
            them to quickly make decisions, don’t put your button on the
            opposite side of the webpage. Put it directly underneath where they
            are supposed to make your decision. A great example of this is the
            Facebook Home Feed. If you are scrolling on the feed, all you have
            to do is move your cursor a couple of inches at most and click then
            you are looking closer at the content you “want”.
